#exercise 32: loops and lists
#question; is a list the same thing as an array?

the_count = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'ears', 'apricots']
change = [1, 'pennies', 2, 'dimes', 3, 'quarters']

# this first kind of for-loop goes through a list
for number in the_count:
    print "This is count %d" % number
